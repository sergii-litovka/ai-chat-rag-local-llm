Key Points
Technical Proficiency: Proficient in the entire software development lifecycle. Expertise includes Java 11-17 with functional programming (Streams, Lambdas), Azure - AWS cloud services, Kafka for real-time data streaming and test-driven development approach, aligning with modern financial system requirements.
Performance Optimization: Proven ability to enhance system performance, critical for real-time market data streaming, like optimization GC parameters,  leveraging off-heap memory (Apache Ignite), parallelizing data processing, adjusting Kafka performance (consumer group rebalancing, back-pressure, and partition misconfiguration etc.), query optimization.
AI/LLM Integration: Architected and implemented production-ready AI systems using Spring AI framework, including custom RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines with PostgreSQL vector stores and HNSW indexing for semantic search. Developed intelligent query expansion algorithms and modular advisor chain architectures for AI prompt processing, enabling context-aware conversational AI with persistent memory management.
System Migration: Contributed to microservices migration by refactoring monolithic code into domain-driven microservices using Spring Boot, aligning bounded contexts with Kafka topics for event-driven, decoupled communication. Ensured data consistency with Kafka Schema Registry, supporting reliable market data streaming. Collaborated via pair-programming and automated CI/CD with Jenkins, monitoring performance with Prometheus and Grafana.
Market Data Expertise: Contributed to developing real-time market data platforms, enhancing a Data as a Service Platform for financial data over two years.
